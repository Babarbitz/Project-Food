\section{Overall Description}

  \subsection{Product Perspective}
  This product is a 2-dimensional video game similar to many games on the market such as Binding of Isaac, Soul Knight, Pok√©mon, and more. Our video game fits in the adventure category for players. The product is independent and totally self-contained, it does not require any other extra programs or internet.

  \subsection{Product Functions}
  \subsection{User Characteristics}
  The education level required would be the completion of middle school. The user must have experience with playing platformer/dungeon crawling games and should know the overall objective of the game. Technical expertise is required for the use of the players movement and action controls and volume adjustment.
  \subsection{Constraints}
  Time will limit the development of the game as we only have a couple of months before its completion. University course load, midterms, and labs will also be a limiting factor.
