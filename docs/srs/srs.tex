\section{Introduction}
% Begin Section
This document provides the specifications for the software titled \textbf{Project Food} (this name is temporary and may change once a decision has been made among the development team). Henceforth, this project shall be referred to as Project Food for the entirety of this document.

This document is split into four major sections. The first (and current) section provides an introduction to the software. Section two elaborates on the overall description of the software. The third and fourth sections contain the functional and non-functional requirements of the product, respectively.

  \subsection{Purpose} 
  % Begin SubSection
  The purpose of this document is to present a functional description of Project Food. The document shall elaborate on the overall description, functional requirements, and non-functional requirements of the software. This document is intended for developers, stakeholders, and users of Project Food.
  % End SubSection
  \subsection{Scope}
  % Begin SubSection

  The primary product produced will be a smart phone based application, namely Project Food. The purpose of the application is to provide entertainment to users by means of a 2D video game. Inspired by the popular game "The Binding of Isaac", users will indulge in a classic rogue-like video game experience by controlling a character, attacking enemies, and collecting items all while making decisions to visit unique procedurally-generated levels. In addition, users will have the ability to choose whether or not they wish to combine collected items, allowing them to upgrade features pertaining to their player. Upgrades will allow users to progress through the increasingly difficult levels, preparing them for various final boss fights.

  The application is intended to provide entertainment for all of its users. The application will be free to download from an application store, thereby maximizing the number of players using the application. The main goal of Project Food is to provide users a challenging, immersive, and friendly mobile video game form of entertainment with the classic rogue-like experience.

  \subsection{Overview}

  % Begin SubSection
  This document is organized into four major sections. Section one (the current section) provided an introduction of Project Food. The remaining three sections of this document are described in detail below. 

  The second section of this document contains the overall description of Project Food. This section will elaborate on the general factors that affect the product and its requirements. This will include the product perspective, the product functions, the user characteristics, constraints, and any relevant assumptions/dependencies.

  The third section of this document contains all of the software functional requirements pertaining to Project Food. These requirements provide the purpose for the products existence as they must meet the clients requirements.

  The fourth section of this document contains a list of the non-functional software requirements pertaining to Project Food. These requirements were created by the development team with the client in mind.

\section{Overall Description}

  \subsection{Product Perspective}
  This product is a 2-dimensional video game similar to many games on the market such as Binding of Isaac, Soul Knight, Pok√©mon, and more. Our video game fits in the adventure category for players. The product is independent and totally self-contained, it does not require any other extra programs or internet.

  \subsection{User Characteristics}
  The education level required would be the completion of middle school. The user must have experience with playing platformer/dungeon crawling games and should know the overall objective of the game. Technical expertise is required for the use of the players movement and action controls and volume adjustment.
  \subsection{Constraints}
  Time will limit the development of the game as we only have a couple of months before its completion. University course load, midterms, and labs will also be a limiting factor.
